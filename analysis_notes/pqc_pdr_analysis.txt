Why Falcon-512 Achieves >99% PDR and <100ms Delay in the Current Simulation
=============================================================================

There are several compounding reasons why the larger PQC (Falcon-512) packet
size is NOT significantly degrading PDR or delay in your current simulation
setup. The configuration is essentially "too favorable" for the impact of
packet size to manifest.

1. OVER-PROVISIONED SIDELINK RESOURCES
---------------------------------------
Your sidelink is configured with:
  - subchannelSize = 10 RBs per subchannel
  - numSubchannels = 10 (total = 100 RBs)
  - maxMCS-PSSCH = 11

With MCS 11 and 10 subchannels (100 RBs), the transport block capacity is
very large — well over 2000 bytes. A Falcon-512 SPDU with ~650-byte signature
+ 897-byte pubkey + BSM payload totals roughly 1600-1800 bytes. This fits
comfortably within the maximum allocation. The MAC layer simply assigns more
subchannels per transmission (e.g., 8-10 instead of 2-3 for ECDSA), but since
the resource pool is large enough, this does not cause resource exhaustion.

In a real congested scenario or with smaller resource pools (e.g., 5
subchannels or subchannelSize=5), Falcon-512 packets would start competing
for and exhausting resources, leading to measurable PDR degradation.

2. LOW VEHICLE DENSITY (for the resource pool size)
----------------------------------------------------
Your scenario has 4 approaches x 600 veh/h = 2400 veh/h total, but the
sim-time-limit is only 40 seconds. At any given moment during 40s, only a
fraction of these vehicles are active in the network simultaneously. With
short road segments (intersection scenario), vehicles transit quickly.

The Channel Busy Ratio (CBR) likely stays well below the 0.65 threshold
where the CBR-based congestion control starts restricting transmissions.
With low CBR, every vehicle gets its resources without contention, so even
large packets don't collide frequently.

3. ALL-LOS CHANNEL MODEL
--------------------------
As discussed in the LOS analysis: dynamic-los=false and fixed-los=true means
every link uses LOS pathloss. This gives artificially high SINR values at
the receiver even at moderate distances. High SINR means:
  - The selected MCS can be high (up to 11), maximizing TB capacity
  - BLER (Block Error Rate) is very low, so almost no packets are lost
    to decoding errors
  - Even with Nakagami fading, LOS pathloss is significantly more
    favorable than NLOS

With NLOS pathloss (which is realistic for an intersection with buildings),
the SINR drops significantly, the effective MCS drops, the TB capacity
shrinks, and larger packets would either:
  (a) not fit in the allocated subchannels, or
  (b) require more subchannels, increasing resource usage and collisions

4. NO HARQ RETRANSMISSIONS
---------------------------
maxHarqRtx = 0 and allowedRetxNumberPSSCH = 0 means there are NO
retransmissions. While this might seem like it should hurt PDR, in this
low-congestion LOS scenario it actually means there's no extra resource
usage from retransmissions. Each packet is sent exactly once. Since the
channel is good (LOS + high SINR), the first transmission almost always
succeeds.

In a congested or NLOS scenario, the lack of retransmissions would
actually hurt larger packets MORE, because they are more susceptible to
partial corruption (more coded bits to get right).

5. SINGLE RSU (V2I is 1-to-many)
----------------------------------
You have numRsu = 1 with txPower = 23 dBm. The RSU broadcasts ICA warnings
and vehicles broadcast BSMs. With only 1 RSU and a moderate number of
vehicles, V2I channel contention is minimal. The RSU's transmissions don't
compete heavily with vehicle BSMs because the SPS resource selection
algorithm has enough resources to avoid collisions.

6. SHORT SIMULATION TIME
--------------------------
sim-time-limit = 40s is quite short. Rare events like sustained congestion
buildup, multiple simultaneous half-duplex collisions, or CBR spikes that
would differentiate Falcon-512 from ECDSA may simply not occur in a 40s
window. Statistical confidence in PDR differences requires longer runs.


HOW TO MAKE PACKET SIZE IMPACT VISIBLE
=======================================

To see the actual effect of Falcon-512's larger packets on V2I performance,
consider these changes:

(a) Enable NLOS: In config_channel.xml, set:
      dynamic-los = true
    or:
      dynamic-los = false, fixed-los = false
    This will use NLOS pathloss, dramatically reducing SINR and making
    larger packets harder to decode.

(b) Reduce resource pool: Try numSubchannels=5 and/or subchannelSize=5.
    This forces more resource contention, and larger Falcon-512 packets
    will consume proportionally more of the pool.

(c) Increase vehicle density: Raise vehsPerHour to 1200-1800 per approach,
    or increase sim-time-limit to 300s+ to allow congestion to build.

(d) Enable retransmissions: Set allowedRetxNumberPSSCH=1, which doubles
    resource usage per packet and amplifies the impact of larger packets.

(e) Reduce MCS: Set maxMCS-PSSCH=7 or lower. This reduces TB capacity,
    making it harder for large Falcon-512 packets to fit.

Any combination of (a)-(e) should make the PDR difference between
Falcon-512 and ECDSA/Dilithium visible.
