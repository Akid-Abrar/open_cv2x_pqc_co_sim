LOS (Line-of-Sight) Analysis for Mode4 Simulation
===================================================

In the current configuration, all communications are LOS (Line-of-Sight).

Evidence from config_channel.xml:

- dynamic-los = false (line 38) — the simulation does NOT dynamically switch
  between LOS/NLOS based on obstacles
- fixed-los = true (line 40) — since dynamic-los is disabled, this parameter
  forces LOS pathloss for all links

Additionally:
- Shadowing is enabled (true)
- Fading is enabled using Nakagami fading with 6 paths
- The Veins config.xml also loads SimpleObstacleShadowing, but the LTE channel
  model itself always uses LOS pathloss

So the physical layer does model fading and shadowing effects, but the path loss
computation is always LOS — it never switches to NLOS even when buildings or
obstacles block the direct path between transmitter and receiver. This means the
simulation is optimistic about signal propagation in obstructed scenarios (e.g.,
around building corners at the intersection).

If you want NLOS modeling, you'd set dynamic-los to true in config_channel.xml,
which would let the channel model switch between LOS/NLOS based on obstacle
geometry.
